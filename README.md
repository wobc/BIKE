The **BIKE cluster** comprises a group of researchers [from](https://wpd.ugr.es/~humneuro/) [different](https://www.ugr.es/~neurocog/) [labs](https://www.memoryugr.es/) of the Mind, Brain, and Behavior Research Center ([CIMCYC](https://cimcyc.ugr.es)) at University of Granada, Spain, with shared interests and vision about the brain and cognition. We collaborate on different projects that generally aim to uncover the nature of internal representations as well as their emergence, maintenance, evolution and decay.
